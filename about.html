      Emma is a mental health nurse who lives in Bristol, UK, with her partner and one surviving houseplant. She initially started learning to code to keep herself busy during a global pandemic lockdown after watching several videos on web development on the Treehouse website. She got bored of Treehouse and instead started to work her way through Harvard's free online CS50 courses, taking the opportunity to get to know javascript and python. She is presently working her way through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project's</a> full stack javascript course. 
<br><br>
      She has enjoyed writing this page about herself in third person because it makes her sound fancy, like she has a biographer, or something. Emma also enjoys entering ridiculous endurance events, climbing and eating large amounts of food. If for some reason you wish to get in touch, please see the <a href="contact.html">contact page</a>. <br><br>Github is <a href="https://github.com/emmadavids/">here.</a></div><br><br>
